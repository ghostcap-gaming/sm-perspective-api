# sm-perspective-api
Originally for CSGO, uses Perspective API <https://perspectiveapi.com/> to give a score ingame on the toxicity of a player. 

Hopefully some people with CSS servers can still make use of this codebase. 

You can then use this to send alerts based on players so your staff can take action on players.
